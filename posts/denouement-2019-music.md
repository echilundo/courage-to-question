<h2 style="text-align: center;">I Was Impressed By</h2>

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">6 Feet Beneath the Moon by King Krule</figcaption>

For the longest time, I had a solitary King Krule song in my library courtesy of Benji B’s excellent year-end playlists. This year, I decided to look up the artist whose name I thought came from Donkey Kong’s arch-nemesis (spoiler: it is sadly not the origin). 

6 Feet Beneath the Moon sounds ethereal at times, and this is partly due to the haunting and magical instruments that dovetail with Archy Marshall’s unique vocal cords. The album is simultaneously intimate, solitary but accessible. You could argue that his second album, The Ooz, is objectively better (and the sound refined), but this is extremely impressive for a 19-year old.

The music doesn’t sound dated. Please give it a try!

**Standout Tracks:**

* Easy, Easy
* Border Line
* Ocean Bed
* Neptune Estate
* The Krockadile

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Dark Jovian by Amon Tobin</figcaption>

Amon Tobin has been around for the longest time, and there's a chance that you might have heard his music somewhere: an electronic club, a movie, a TV show or the acclaimed video game, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.

In 2015, the Brazilian virtuoso decided to essentially create a soundtrack for those 70s / 80s space exploration movies that sometimes include elements of horror. Dear readers, he knocked it out of the park.

There is an intense sense of scale akin I suppose to discovering that you are insignificant in the wake of the great cosmos. Perfect ambient music for work, or any of your role-playing sessions.

**Standout Tracks:**

* Io
* Encounter On Io (Lee Gamble Remix)
* Adrestea Contact (Logos Remix)

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">IGOR by Tyler, the Creator</figcaption>

Tyler, the Creator is one of my favorite artists. I don’t know how the human body can contain so much creativity. IGOR was released earlier this and year and his arguably his best work.

While his previous effort, Flower Boy,  was a magnum opus focused on the start and blooming of a new relationship, IGOR is easily its dark twin wherein Tyler deals with the breakup and all the emotions that come with it. Eerily enough, both mirror the start and end of a relationship of mine and were released at roughly the same period: 2017 and 2019.

IGOR continues to highlight his growth both as a human being and one of the premier artists of his generation. I can’t wait to see what he does next.

**Standout Tracks:**

* IGOR’s Theme (feat. Kali Uchis & Lil Uzi Vert)
* EARFQUAKE (feat. Charlie Wilson, Devonté Hynes & Playboi Carti)
* NEW MAGIC WAND (feat. Santigold & A$AP Rocky)
* A BOY IS A GUN
* PUPPET (feat. Kanye West)
* WHAT'S GOOD (feat. slowthai)
* GONE, GONE / THANK YOU
