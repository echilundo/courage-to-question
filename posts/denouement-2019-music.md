<h2 style="text-align: center;">I Was Impressed By</h2>

![krule](/static/img/krule.png#center)

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">6 Feet Beneath the Moon by King Krule</figcaption>

For the longest time, I had a solitary King Krule song in my library courtesy of Benji B’s excellent year-end playlists. This year, I decided to look up the artist whose name I thought came from Donkey Kong’s arch-nemesis (spoiler: it is sadly not the origin). 

6 Feet Beneath the Moon sounds ethereal at times, and this is partly due to the haunting and magical instruments that dovetail with Archy Marshall’s unique vocal cords. The album is simultaneously intimate, solitary but accessible. You could argue that his second album, The Ooz, is objectively better (and the sound refined), but this is extremely impressive for a 19-year old.

The music doesn’t sound dated. Please give it a try!

**Standout Tracks:**

* Easy, Easy
* Border Line
* Ocean Bed
* Neptune Estate
* The Krockadile

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Dark Jovian by Amon Tobin</figcaption>

Amon Tobin has been around for the longest time, and there's a chance that you might have heard his music somewhere: an electronic club, a movie, a TV show or the acclaimed video game, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.

In 2015, the Brazilian virtuoso decided to essentially create a soundtrack for those 70s / 80s space exploration movies that sometimes include elements of horror. Dear readers, he knocked it out of the park.

There is an intense sense of scale akin I suppose to discovering that you are insignificant in the wake of the great cosmos. Perfect ambient music for work, or any of your role-playing sessions.

**Standout Tracks:**

* Io
* Encounter On Io (Lee Gamble Remix)
* Adrestea Contact (Logos Remix)

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">IGOR by Tyler, the Creator</figcaption>

Tyler, the Creator is one of my favorite artists. I don’t know how the human body can contain so much creativity. IGOR was released earlier this and year and his arguably his best work.

While his previous effort, Flower Boy,  was a magnum opus focused on the start and blooming of a new relationship, IGOR is easily its dark twin wherein Tyler deals with the breakup and all the emotions that come with it. Eerily enough, both mirror the start and end of a relationship of mine and were released at roughly the same period: 2017 and 2019.

IGOR continues to highlight his growth both as a human being and one of the premier artists of his generation. I can’t wait to see what he does next.

**Standout Tracks:**

* IGOR’s Theme (feat. Kali Uchis & Lil Uzi Vert)
* EARFQUAKE (feat. Charlie Wilson, Devonté Hynes & Playboi Carti)
* NEW MAGIC WAND (feat. Santigold & A$AP Rocky)
* A BOY IS A GUN
* PUPPET (feat. Kanye West)
* WHAT'S GOOD (feat. slowthai)
* GONE, GONE / THANK YOU

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">The Mandalorian Score by Ludwig van Göransson</figcaption>

Ludwig Göransson (named after Beethoven) is known for his outstanding work with director Ryan Coogler (he of Fruitvale Station, Creed, and Black Panther Fame) and being behind the boards of the multi-talented Donald Glover / Childish Gambino. The latter is an integral part of the TV shows  Community and Atlanta as well as releasing wondrous songs such as This is America and Redbone.

When Ludwig was tasked with creating the exotic sound of The Mandalorian, the madman decided to craft an individual score for each episode. He’s managed to create an iconic theme that far surpasses anything in the Disney-released Star Wars films.

I am extremely excited to hear his score for Christopher “Can Do Almost Nothing Wrong Except Interstellar and Dunkirk” Nolan’s TENƎT.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">I Was Disappointed By</h2>



![crashtalk](/static/img/crashtalk.png#center)

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">CrasH Talk by ScHoolboy Q</figcaption>

The Q is a great musician, able to talk about the pleasures of life with a certain panache. His iconic bucket hat, followed by an iconic snarling voice are the cherries on top.

Following two Grammy-nominated albums (yes, I know that it’s essentially a popularity contest…but they were legit good) and a dizzying array of top-notch guest appearances…the world was feverishly waiting for his next great album.

It came. And went. That’s how you know you did badly. Not great, but not terrible. ScHoolboy Q sounds tired and lethargic even on supposedly high energy bangers. There are some stand out tracks though, especially those that tackle mental health, fame, and his role as a father.

You know what pissed me off though? 

In literally every other song he's featured this year, he sounds like his old self. I suppose some experiments pay off, and others don’t.

**Best of the Rest**

* *Bandana by Freddie Gibbs & Madlib* - The return of the winning combination of Freddie Gibbs’ ridiculous flow and Madlib’s insane production. The man composed every song on an iPhone. Pity about the former’s anti-vaxxer position.
* *Diaspora by Goldlink* - I'm gonna let Yoh Phillips from DJ Booth handle this one: “a one-man Afropunk lineup, molding and morphing a potpourri of soundscapes in his image”.
* *Lifa by Heilung*- A last-minute discovery thanks to Microsoft and Ninja Theory’s fantastic Hellblade II trailer. I honestly think a Nordic shaman time-traveled to the 21st century and recorded an album once he discovered modern drums. It’s brilliant.
* *Fever by Megan Thee Stallion* - A multi-dimensional female empowerment album. Megan sparks joy.
* * *MF BLOOM + Flowervillain II by MF DOOM vs. Tyler The Creator* - A laid-back mash-up of two wildly different artists. It just works.
* *II by TNGHT* - Not as good as their debut effort, but quite an earworm of an album. It definitely sounds more spacious.
* *The Lion King: The Gift by Beyoncé* - A much more pan-African album than Lamar’s Black Panther one. But it still neglects large swaths of the continent. Nevertheless, your ears won’t regret this.
