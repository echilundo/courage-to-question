This year, I read quite the number of books, comics (errr…graphic novels) and articles.

*Why* do I read?

For fun of course, but I have noticed over the past two years I have noticed a trend towards books and articles that help me explain the world I was born into. Especially the easier-to-grasp topics such as economics, cultural & societal change, technology, and politics.

You could argue that it’s the way I learn best, but truthfully, there isn’t any method that’s objectively better. However, there are objectively better ways to present certain types of content: such as seeing a visual representation of a food recipe as opposed to plain text.

As a quick aside, let me show you my reading statistics from Pocket this year:

So…I guess another another reason I read is in the hopes of becoming an expert generalist. A buzzword to be sure, but the simplest way to explain it. There isn’t a singular path to it, and even this very website are part of the steps towards it. BUT…I have heavily digressed.

<h2 style=“text-align: center;”>I Was Impressed By</h2>

I have a love-hate relationship with Marvel Comics, but I think the X-Men are the most interesting set of characters they have. After a missteps recently, the company decided to relaunch the entire series under the stewardship of Jonathan Hickman. For three months, I feverishly waited for every Wednesday to get my hands on a copy of the next installment. It is something I had never done before in all the years I had read comics.

In Dawn of X, mutants have a completely new status quo: their own language, culture, societal structure, government (laws), and export. Hickman has even added interesting elements of sci-fi and cosmic horror without it seeming hokey.

These twelve issues cover the establishment of the aforementioned and how the difficulties mutants have in maintaining cordial relations with a world that hates and/or fears them. It’s not perfect and the X-Men world has always been a difficult to fit into the greater Marvel Universe, but this is a story well worth of your time.

<h2 style=“text-align: center;”>I Was Disappointed By</h2>

\*Identity: Contemporary Identity Politics and the Struggle for Recognition by Francis Fukuyama\*

Much has been said about Francis Fukuyama’s earlier works, and thus I dipped into his most recent body of work. Compared to my parents, I was less exposed to philosophy and the study of society in general throughout my school years. So…reading a heavily summarized version of this was a great window into a new world. But the last few chapters were quite disappointing. I didn’t expect answers, but as a person who has struggled with identity and his place in the world: it was far less than I expected. Maybe the problem is me?

\*The Dark Knight III: The Master Race\*

Ah, Frank Miller.

Known for Batman: Year One, The Dark Knight Returns, Sin City, and 300. All have had their impact on pop culture in different ways. It was clearly a period of super-competence. Because THIS IS TRASH. It is one of the worst things I have ever had the displeasure of reading.

**Best of the Rest**

* *Doomsday Clock by Geoff Johns* - A standalone story that examines the dichotomy of Dr. Manhattan and Superman. An interesting tale that is worth a read.
* *Hold Me Tight: Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love by Sue Johnson* - Forced me to reanalyze my last relationship and how I was a poor communicator, even though I thought I was a good one…
* *Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That’ll Improve and/or Ruin Everything by Kelly & Zach Weinersmith* - A brief and sometimes comical read on technologies that could have the potential to be game-changing.
* *That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea by Marc Randolp*h - Of course, these stories almost always use the best / worst parts of the story. But there are some useful lessons here for both professional and personal use.
