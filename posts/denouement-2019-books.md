This year, I read quite the number of books, comics (errr...graphic novels) and articles.

_Why_ do I read?

For fun of course, but I have noticed over the past two years I have noticed a trend towards books and articles that help me explain the world I was born into. Especially the easier-to-grasp topics such as economics, cultural & societal change, technology, and politics.

You could argue that it's the way I learn best, but truthfully, there isn't any method that's objectively better. However, there are objectively better ways to present certain types of content: such as seeing a visual representation of a food recipe as opposed to plain text.

As a quick aside, let me show you something from last year:

That's a lot of reading, and a regular occurrence since 2015. I expect this year to be no less different. The post will be updated when I get my statistics for this year.

So..._Why_ do I read?

I read in the hopes of becoming an expert generalist. A buzzword to be sure, but the simplest way to explain it. There isn't a singular path to it, and even this very website are part of the steps towards it. BUT...I have heavily digressed.

</p>

I have a love-hate relationship with Marvel Comics, but I think the X-Men are the most interesting set of characters they have. After a missteps recently, the company decided to relaunch the entire series under the stewardship of Jonathan Hickman.

For three months, I feverishly waited for every Wednesday to get my hands on a copy of the next installment. It is something I had never done before in all the years I had read comics.

In Dawn of X, mutants have a completely new status quo: their own language, culture, societal structure, government (laws), and export. Hickman has even added interesting elements of sci-fi and cosmic horror without it seeming hokey.

These twelve issues cover the establishment of the aforementioned and how the difficulties mutants have in maintaining cordial relations with a world that hates and/or fears them.

It's not perfect and the X-Men world has always been a difficult to fit into the greater Marvel Universe, but this is a story well worth of your time.

**Dogs and Demons**

This book was a recommendation by a good friend of mine, though I was wary of approaching it from my own experiences in Kyoto where I:

* Experienced culture, academics and business in an almost equal measure;
* I dated a half Japanese-half Ethiopian person for a while;
* Did all this from mostly Anglo-American worldview mixed in with elements of lusophonia and Mozambique.

That out of the way, **Dogs and Demons** is a fascinating, but by no means perfect read. While dated in parts by now, many of the underlying aspects that are talked about are still relevant today (even if it is written by a non-Japanese national). A number of the thoughts laid out here have begun to be echoed by Japanese nationals. Though mostly those who find themselves outside the usual system, whether it's voluntary or not. In the case of my…ex-girlfriend she’s very Japanese in her behavior (IMO) but there is enough difference in it and enough melanin in her skin that she often found herself as the one on the outside looking in. Which made it extremely interesting to learn about Japan from someone with one foot in and another out.

Economically, I suppose it \[Japan] skates by. Consumption is the name of the game, usually driven by large companies or the ever-looming _keiretsus_. Back in 2001, Alex Kerr said that startups were not really a thing in Japan. Today, the culture is taking off, albeit slowly. This is interesting considering that a significant amount of patents are developed in Japan on a yearly basis. My guess is that the present situation is a direct result of intrapreneurship (without the usual rewards) and not entrepreneurship.

Recently, JETRO has opened a section on the site where companies interested in hiring foreign employees. At the time of this writing, a grand total of 18 companies are listed. Which isn’t much…but it’s a start.

Japan is a remarkable country which is facing something of an identity crisis. A crisis that tends to be ignored in lieu of harmony (read: obedience). **Dogs and Demons** provides substantial evidence as to why this is the case, and this is backed up (mind you, anecdotally). Perhaps this is confirmation bias, and a result of my own experience with an identity crisis and brushes with anthropology and psychology in my personal, professional and academic lives. Being a third culture individual only served to exarcerbate this.

As an expat, reading this made me doubly concerned about the direction the country is heading in and the relative indifference that the general folk have regarding its future. Or just plain nihilism. Internally, you can see the strain caused by a number of different things. And externally, Japan has to interact in a sociopolitical climate that is very dynamic and often places it on a pedestal. It is this pedestal that allows it to continue exercising its soft power in myriad ways. But that is only part of the answer.

The soft power includes but is not limited to anime, video games, (apparent) recycling, (apparent) extreme productivity, and all the vehicle spare parts that less industrialized nations have to purchase from them. Language and its interpretation are used as barriers to discourage outsiders to learning too much about how things really work. On the flip side, their lack of foreign language skills sometimes bites them in ass. The Olympics next year will be interesting, as even emergency respondents hardly speak English: a microcosm of a larger issue.

Of course, Japan isn’t alone in doing some pseudo cloak and dagger warfare. America, Russia and China come to mind. But it is certainly given some sort of free pass that isn’t bestowed on the others for some reason or another. Especially since its position on the Press Freedom Index has slid dramatically over the past few years.

Don’t get me wrong, Japan has slowly made headway in terms of being more aware of internal problems and in some cases, being more proactive. Some of the industries have had new life breathed into them either by design or by chance. But in my opinion, these changes are happening too slowly - if at all).

Dogs and Demons isn’t the be-all end-all body of text that will educate you on all the finer points on how and why Japan is today. But it’s a substantial enough starting point that will allow you to think a bit more critically about one of the greatest and (one of the most misunderstood) nation states on the planet.

With all the criticism, I found myself moving back to Japan. Better the demon you know, right?

I welcome a discussion on any and all of what I’ve covered here. It will be an opportunity for all of us to learn and fine tune (or correct) our thoughts on Japan and its people. Our world views may clash, but hopefully we’ll come out of it with more information and more wisdom to build a…harmonious world. Harmony as acceptance of differences, and not as “a denial of differences and an embrace of sameness. Sameness in interpersonal relationships means a reflection of the other, the basic concept of which derives from narcissism”.

I also recommend that you watch the documentary [_Shusenjo - The Main Battleground of the Comfort Women Issue_](https://www.shusenjo.com). It’s a harrowing, but essential watch.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">I Was Disappointed By</h2>

Anyone who has known for a good period of time knows that I LOVE Mass Effect. I bought the original on Xbox 360 and PC. I bought Dragon Age: Origins just because it had the armor for the sequel (honestly, the world of Thedas was an afterthought for me). Bought the limited edition of Mass Effect 2. And my then-girlfriend bought the limited edition of Mass Effect 3 for my birthday. I still feel slightly guilty about that because that game's ending was terrible. Don't believe me? Google "ME3 ending reaction".

BUT, the universe that BioWare had created was quite something and was often referred to as this generation's Star Trek. So when a new game was announced in 2014, it's an understatement to say I was excited.

I got it in the bargain bin about a year and a half after its release in Mach 2017. Not even my crush on virtual Cora could distract me from the long cortège I decided to embark on. This is what wasted potential looks like in video game form.

Investigative journalist, Jason Schreier, provided us with an account of the troubled development of the game [here](https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-mass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-1795886428).

Made by the people behind the juggernaut that is the Grand Theft Auto series, this game really tested my sangfroid. Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastically realized world made with a LOT of care. It is honestly the best cowboy simulator ever made.

But I keep fighting the in-game systems and the controller to do what I want. Perhaps there is something about it emulating how difficult life was for those in the Wild West. I don't know. I played the first Witcher game when it was released, and I don't remember being this frustrated.

I have played this for 25-30 hours. I have yet to finish it.

But do feast your eyes on photos and videos I've taken [here](https://iamedson.com/red-dead). Plus, I recommend Film Crit Hulk's thoughts on the game [here](https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/22/18298277/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review-rdr2-story-design-criticism).

I won't spend too much time on this. The game is masterful at making you feel like Spidey from beginning to end with controls that are intuitive. Shame about the story though (with the major of exception of Peter and MJ's relationship: that was damn good).

I took some [photos](https://iamedson.com/spidey) too.

**Best of the Rest**

* Dying Light - played in a LAN over the course of a weekend. Good fun.
* Horizon: Zero Dawn ([photoset](https://iamedson.com/horizon)) - well-realized world that was missing that extra oomph. I am optimistic for the inevitable sequel.
* Uncharted: The Nation Drake Collection ([photoset](https://iamedson.com/uncharted)) - Overrated? Yes. Fun? Also yes.
