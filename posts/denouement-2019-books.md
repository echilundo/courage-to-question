This year, I read quite the number of books, comics (errr…graphic novels) and articles.

*Why* do I read?

For fun of course, but I have noticed over the past two years I have noticed a trend towards books and articles that help me explain the world I was born into. Especially the easier-to-grasp topics such as economics, cultural & societal change, technology, and politics.

You could argue that it’s the way I learn best, but truthfully, there isn’t any method that’s objectively better. However, there are objectively better ways to present certain types of content: such as seeing a visual representation of a food recipe as opposed to plain text.

As a quick aside, let me show you my reading statistics from Pocket this year:

<h2 style=“text-align: center;”>I Was Disappointed By</h2>

\*Identity: Contemporary Identity Politics and the Struggle for Recognition by Francis Fukuyama\*

Much has been said about Francis Fukuyama’s earlier works, and thus I dipped into his most recent body of work. Compared to my parents, I was less exposed to philosophy and the study of society in general throughout my school years. So…reading a heavily summarized version of this was a great window into a new world. But the last few chapters were quite disappointing. I didn’t expect answers, but as a person who has struggled with identity and his place in the world: it was far less than I expected. Maybe the problem is me?

\\*The Dark Knight III: The Master Race\\*


Ah, Frank Miller.


Known for Batman: Year One, The Dark Knight Returns, Sin City, and 300. All have had their impact on pop culture in different ways.
It was clearly a period of super-competence. Because THIS IS TRASH. It is one of the worst things I have ever the displeasure of reading.
