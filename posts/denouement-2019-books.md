This year, I read quite the number of books, comics (errr…graphic novels) and articles. *Why* do I read?

For fun of course, but I have noticed over the past two years I have noticed a trend towards books and articles that help me explain the world I was born into. Especially the easier-to-grasp topics such as economics, cultural & societal change, technology, and politics.

You could argue that it’s the way I learn best, but truthfully, there isn’t any method that’s objectively better. However, there are objectively better ways to present certain types of content: such as seeing a visual representation of a food recipe as opposed to plain text.

As a quick aside, let me show you my reading statistics from Pocket this year:

That’s a lot of reading, and a regular occurrence since 2015.

So…*Why* do I read?

I read in the hopes of becoming an expert generalist. A buzzword to be sure, but the simplest way to explain it. There isn’t a singular path to it, and even this very website are part of the steps towards it. BUT…I have heavily digressed.

I have a love-hate relationship with Marvel Comics, but I think the X-Men are the most interesting set of characters they have. After a missteps recently, the company decided to relaunch the entire series under the stewardship of Jonathan Hickman. For three months, I feverishly waited for every Wednesday to get my hands on a copy of the next installment. It is something I had never done before in all the years I had read comics.

In Dawn of X, mutants have a completely new status quo: their own language, culture, societal structure, government (laws), and export. Hickman has even added interesting elements of sci-fi and cosmic horror without it seeming hokey.

These twelve issues cover the establishment of the aforementioned and how the difficulties mutants have in maintaining cordial relations with a world that hates and/or fears them. It’s not perfect and the X-Men world has always been a difficult to fit into the greater Marvel Universe, but this is a story well worth of your time.

This book was recommended by a good friend of mine. When I approached it, I was wary of bias due to my own experiences in Kyoto where I:

* Experienced culture, academics and business in an almost equal measure;
* I dated a half Japanese-half Ethiopian person for a while;
* Did all this from mostly Anglo-American worldview mixed in with elements of *lusophonia* and Mozambique.
