For a substantial part of this year, I found myself unemployed and there with a lot of free time on my hands. A part of that was spent on learning design, coding and job-hunting...and the other on attempting to catch up on an ever-growing backlog of games on both Steam and PSN.

**Impressed**

 In the past, Kratos and the God of War franchise represented teenage power fantasies (with some angst). Though, it did so with excellent mechanics that have influenced countless other games. In the years between the two major releases, the video game industry matured some more and culture became incrementally more politically correct. Did Kratos still have room in the modern world?

That, dear readers, is a resounding yes. God of War (2018) became an instant classic when it came out in April 2018. Having played the previous entries, and followed the marketing campaign for this latest iteration: I was very excited.

It took me a little over a year to finally delve in, and boy -- this is a purchase I will never regret. Without any spoilers, God of War is a game about family, redemption and sacrifice. Backed by Bear McCreary and a stellar orchestra / choir, this adventure takes you through an interesting interpretation of Norse mythology and the relationship between a father and his son. The story is not perfect, but it resonated with me in a way that few other games have. Those stupid Valkyries though…

I also had a blast with the photo mode, and you can see the results of that [here](https://iamedson.com/god-of-war). 

Sony released a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_R-K_IoUc) documenting the herculean process  reimagining Kratos and the God of War franchise. If you have played the game, it is essential viewing. Hell, even if you have no interest of ever playing the game, I still recommend it.

Hitman

How do you take a character who has barcode tattoo on the back of his head seriously? You don’t. What you do - do though is engage in a terrific sandbox that takes place all over the world: just to assassinate someone. Mission too easy for you? Do all of it in a Santa Claus outfit? How about sneaking into the top floor of a heavily guarded mansion to get rid of a corrupt agent with a samurai sword? It’s ridiculous and I love it. My go-to game for some downtime.

Overcooked

On my to-play list since release, I finally dipped in courtesy of PSN Plus. It’s a fantastic, quirky game that led to several moments of tension and stress between my brothers and I. But it’s all so satisfying when it comes together at the end. I can only assume that playing this with a significant other make put a (temporary) strain not her relationship.

**Disappointed**

Made by the people behind the juggernaut that is the Grand Theft Auto series, this game really tested my sangfroid. Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastically realized world made with a LOT of care. It is honestly the best cowboy simulator ever made.

But I keep fighting the in-game systems and the controller to do what I want. Perhaps there is something about it emulating how difficult life was for those in the Wild West. I don't know. I played the first Witcher game when it was released, and I don't remember being this frustrated.

I have played this for 25-30 hours. I have yet to finish it.

But to enjoy some of the photos and videos I've taken [here](https://iamedson.com/red-dead). And read blogger extraordinaire Film Crit Hulk's thoughts on the game [here](https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/22/18298277/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review-rdr2-story-design-criticism).

Spider-Man

I won't spend too much time on this. The game is masterful at making you feel like Spidey from beginning to end with controls that are intuitive. Shame about the story though (with the major of exception of Peter and MJ's relationship: that was damn good).
