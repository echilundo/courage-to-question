Making a piece of media, any piece, is hard work. It is often a collaborative effort, that sometimes yields great results…and other times does not. Every year I'll share what I liked and what disappointed me.

Presumably, you value my opinion (even if you don’t agree with it) - and that’s why you’re on this page right now.

The rules for consideration are simple: these are based on experiencing them this calendar year, and not the actual release date of said book, etc.

This is the main post and will be updated as soon as the other entries are published. It should go up right up until the end of the year in the following order:

* Games
* Books
* TV Shows
* Movies
* Music

These posts are likely to be lengthy and meant to be consumed with a good cup of tea or coffee.
