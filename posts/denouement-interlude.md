I've been quite busy with work and have not had time to write other content. But, my yearly "Best-of" playlist is now available.

The original playlist is made in Apple Music and converted to both Spotify and YouTube. Some songs will be missing because they aren't available on other platforms.

This curated always includes music from all four corners of the planet and covers a dizzying amount of genres.
